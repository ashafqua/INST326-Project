**Application:** Weather Forecaster

**Team Members:** Ayesha Shafquat and Aisha Koroma 

**Files Includes:** 
- App.py: Main python script of the application. 
- App.ipynb: Script is given in a jupyter notebook, making it user accessible across multiple platforms

**Explanation:** 
We have accomplished to create a Weather Forecaster. This app is able to take user input of any city and display the real time weather details. The real time weather information is gathered by using an openweathermap API. The information we used from the API includes: city, conditions, temperature, wind speed, wind direction, humidty, local coordinates, and high/low temperatures. 

**Instructions:**
In order to run the app on your computer:
1. Download the python script or notebook file (if you are using jupyter). 
2. Download the background image. 
3. Make sure the script and background image are in the same location on your computer. 
4. Open the script and press run. 
5. Enter a city along with the full state or country name. 
    - Ex. College Park, Maryland or Islamabad, Pakistan. 
    - The input does not take acronyms for states, although allows USA. 
6. Press the "Get Weather" button
7. Enjoy!
